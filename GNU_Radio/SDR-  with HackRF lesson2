1.Does the flowgraph behave differently if you remove the throttle block? (Connect the source directly to the sink.)


2.Does the FFT sink correctly indicate the frequency produced by the source? What if the source and sink have different sample rates configured?

3.What happens if you configure the signal source with various frequencies between 0 and 16k?


4.What if you specify frequencies greater than 16k? Any idea why?


5.What if you specify negative frequencies? Mathematically, is there a difference between cos(x) and cos(-x)?


6.Does the plot indicate the presence of any frequencies other than the one produced by the source? (Hint: Use Autoscale or increase dB/Div.) What is the apparent amplitude of the noise? Why is there any noise at all?


7.Try multiple signal sources added together. Are there any other interesting operations you could try?
Try various waveforms (instead of cosine) in the signal source.
